# Fast Boolean Array

In JavaScript, when working with large arrays of boolean values, a common challenge is efficiently indexing and retrieving these values. Using a regular JavaScript array to store booleans is straightforward, but it is memory-inefficient. While booleans are conceptually 1-bit values, JavaScript engines, like V8 (in Chrome and Node.js), allocate 1 byte (8 bits) per boolean for optimization purposes. This can waste a significant amount of memory when dealing with large arrays.

Fast Boolean Array solves this issue by utilizing bit manipulation to store booleans in a compact format. It uses a Uint8Array and stores each boolean as a single bit within the 8 bits of each byte. This allows you to index and retrieve boolean values by integers (e.g., the 0th boolean, 1st boolean, etc.) while only using a fraction of the memory. Each bit represents a boolean, and you can quickly access or modify a specific boolean using bitwise operations, making it both fast and memory-efficient.

For detailed benchmark results, see below.

## Features

- **Memory Efficiency**: Stores booleans in bits rather than bytes, drastically reducing memory usage.
- **Simple API**: Intuitive methods for setting and getting values.
- **Performance**: Optimized for use in scenarios where memory constraints are critical.

## Installation

Install the package via npm:

```bash
npm install fast-boolean-array
```

---

## Usage

Here's how to use the Fast Boolean Array:

```javascript
import BooleanArray from 'fast-boolean-array';
// const BooleanArray = require('fast-boolean-array'); works too

// Create a new BooleanArray with the desired size
const booleans = new BooleanArray(2);

// Set a value at a specific index
booleans.set(0, true);
booleans.set(1, false);

// Retrieve it
console.log(booleans.get(0)); // Output: true
console.log(booleans.get(1)); // Output: false

booleans.set(3, true); // will not throw, but returns false as the boolean is not found
console.log(booleans.get(3)); // Output: false

booleans.setSafe(3, true); // will throw RangeError
```

## API

### `new BooleanArray(size)`

Creates a new boolean array of the given size. All values are initialized to `false`.

- **Parameters:**
  - `size` (number): The number of booleans the array should hold.

### `set(index, value)`

Sets the boolean value at the specified index.

- **Parameters:**
  - `index` (number): The position in the array to set the value.
  - `value` (boolean): The value to set (`true` or `false`).

### `get(index)`

Gets the boolean value at the specified index.

- **Parameters:**

  - `index` (number): The position in the array to retrieve the value.

- **Returns:**
  - `boolean`: The value at the given index.

## Why Use Fast Boolean Array?

- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Ideal for applications handling large boolean arrays, such as data compression or state tracking.
- **Easy to Use**: Familiar `Map` and `Set` like API for minimal learning curve.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for high-performance, memory-sensitive projects.

# Performance Breakdown

Our benchmark compares the performance of our Fast Boolean Array library against Vanilla JavaScript arrays in terms of get and set operations across varying numbers of Booleans. The results below reflect an updated benchmark algorithm that performs 1,000 runs for each x amount of Booleans to better simulate real-world scenarios.

## Performance Breakdown

### Summary

- The **Fast Boolean Array** is significantly more efficient in terms of memory usage and **Set** operation speeds, particularly as the number of booleans increases.
  - For example, at **10,000,000 booleans**, it is **7.5x faster** in **Set** operations and uses **8x less memory**.
- The **Get** operation, however, tends to be slower for the **Fast Boolean Array**, with it being up to **1.5x slower** compared to the **Vanilla Array** in larger datasets.
- If memory efficiency and **Set** performance are priorities, the **Fast Boolean Array** is clearly advantageous, but if **Get** performance is more important, the **Vanilla Array** may still offer better results for certain use cases.
